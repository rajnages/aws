1. Deploy a Scalable Web Application with Load Balancing and Auto Scaling
Description: Set up a web application using EC2 instances and configure Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to distribute traffic. Configure an Auto Scaling group to ensure the application scales based on traffic demand.
Skills Covered:
EC2 instance management and types
Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) setup and configuration
Auto Scaling policies and configuration
Steps:
Launch EC2 instances for the web application.
Set up an ELB in front of the EC2 instances.
Create an Auto Scaling group to manage instance scaling based on CPU or request load.
Use CloudWatch to monitor metrics and trigger scaling policies.
Goal: This project will teach you how to handle traffic fluctuations, high availability, and fault tolerance using EC2.
