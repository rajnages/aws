Auto Scaling policies and configuration
Steps:
Launch EC2 instances for the web application.
Set up an ELB in front of the EC2 instances.
Create an Auto Scaling group to manage instance scaling based on CPU or request load.
Use CloudWatch to monitor metrics and trigger scaling policies.
Goal: This project will teach you how to handle traffic fluctuations, high availability, and fault tolerance using EC2.

# 2. Implement a Secure EC2-based Environment with VPC and IAM
Description: Design and implement a secure network architecture for an EC2 instance, focusing on security best practices.
Skills Covered:
VPC configuration, including subnets, security groups, and network ACLs
IAM roles, policies, and instance profiles
Encryption and secure data handling
Steps:
Create a custom VPC with public and private subnets.
Place an EC2 instance in the private subnet and configure a NAT Gateway for internet access.
Create an IAM role for the instance with least-privilege access and enable encryption for any associated EBS volumes.
Goal: This project helps you understand how to secure EC2 instances in a networked environment and manage permissions effectively.

# 3. Automate Deployment with AWS Elastic Beanstalk and EC2
Description: Use Elastic Beanstalk to deploy an application and manage EC2 instances automatically.
Skills Covered:
AWS Elastic Beanstalk basics and application deployment
EC2 instance provisioning with managed services
Load balancing and Auto Scaling in Elastic Beanstalk
Steps:
Create a sample application (e.g., a Node.js or Python app) and deploy it using Elastic Beanstalk.
Customize the environment configuration, such as instance type, scaling policies, and load balancing settings.
Experiment with environment updates and rollback options.
Goal: This project teaches you how to deploy applications quickly and manage environments using Elastic Beanstalk, which automates EC2 provisioning and scaling.

# 4. Set Up a CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins on EC2
Description: Deploy a Jenkins server on EC2 and configure a CI/CD pipeline for application deployment.
Skills Covered:
Jenkins setup on EC2
CI/CD pipeline configuration and management
Integration with GitHub, Docker, and other tools
Steps:
Launch an EC2 instance and install Jenkins.
Configure Jenkins to pull code from a version control repository (e.g., GitHub) and automate build, test, and deployment processes.
Optionally, integrate Docker for containerized deployments and deploy on other EC2 instances or ECS.
Goal: Gain experience setting up a CI/CD pipeline on EC2, which is essential 
for automating deployments and improving development workflows.

# 5. Host a Serverless Website with S3 and EC2 Backend for APIs
Description: Host a static website using S3 and connect it to a backend API running on EC2.
Skills Covered:
Hosting static content in Amazon S3
API development and hosting on EC2
Securing API endpoints with API Gateway and IAM roles
Steps:
Host a static HTML/JavaScript site in an S3 bucket with public access enabled.
Develop a simple REST API (e.g., using Node.js or Python) on EC2.
Use API Gateway to expose the EC2 API securely, and connect the S3 website to it.
Goal: This project will teach you to integrate EC2 with serverless components (S3, API Gateway), focusing on security and architecture best 
practices.

# 6. Real-Time Log Analysis with ELK Stack on EC2
Description: Set up the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack on EC2 for real-time log monitoring and analysis.
Skills Covered:
ELK stack installation and configuration on EC2
Log data ingestion, parsing, and visualization
Monitoring and alerting using Kibana dashboards
Steps:
Launch EC2 instances for each ELK stack component (or use a single instance for simplicity).
Configure Logstash to ingest and parse log data (e.g., system logs or web server logs).
Use Kibana to create dashboards and set up alerts based on log patterns.
Goal: Learn how to implement real-time log monitoring and analysis using EC2, which is useful for application monitoring and troubleshooting.

# 7. Data Processing Pipeline Using EC2 and S3
Description: Build a data processing pipeline where data is stored in S3 and processed by a Python or Spark application running on EC2.
Skills Covered:
Data storage and retrieval using S3
Batch processing with Python or Spark on EC2
Data transfer between S3 and EC2, cost optimization, and processing at scale
Steps:
Create a script to load raw data into an S3 bucket.
Set up an EC2 instance to run a Python or Spark application that processes the data.
Save processed data back to S3 and automate the process with a cron job or Data Pipeline.
Goal: This project helps you learn data processing workflows on AWS, with EC2 as the compute layer and S3 as the storage layer.

# 8. Disaster Recovery Plan Using EC2 Backups and Snapshots
Description: Develop a disaster recovery plan by creating regular backups and snapshots of EC2 instances.
Skills Covered:
AMI creation and EBS snapshot automation
Data recovery and failover strategies
Automation with AWS Lambda and CloudWatch Events
Steps:
Set up a CloudWatch Event rule to create daily snapshots of EBS volumes and AMIs for your EC2 instances.
Use AWS Lambda to automate the deletion of old snapshots to manage costs.
Test the recovery process by launching new instances from snapshots and AMIs.
Goal: Understand how to plan for disaster recovery, a critical part of EC2 operations, and automate backup tasks to ensure data integrity and availability.

# 9. EC2-Powered Machine Learning Model Deployment
Description: Train a machine learning model and deploy it on an EC2 instance as an API for inference.
Skills Covered:
Machine learning model training and optimization
API development and deployment on EC2
Securing endpoints and managing performance
Steps:
Train a simple machine learning model using scikit-learn or TensorFlow.
Save the model and deploy it on an EC2 instance using a web framework (e.g., Flask or FastAPI).
Create an API endpoint for inference requests and optimize for fast responses.
Goal: This project will give you experience in deploying and managing ML models on EC2, integrating data science and AWS.
