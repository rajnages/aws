# EC2 Intro
1.Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service from Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provides scalable, on-demand compute power in the cloud. It’s designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers by offering virtual servers, known as instances, which you can launch, configure, and control to suit your application needs.
EC2 gives users the ability to deploy instances in different configurations, based on CPU, memory, storage, and network requirements.

# 2.Origins of EC2
EC2 was introduced in 2006 as part of AWS's initial offerings. It marked the beginning of a new era where developers could rent compute resources instead of investing heavily in on-premises hardware. This innovation reduced upfront costs, accelerated application development, and allowed companies to scale as needed.

# 3.Why and When to Use EC2
Use Cases for EC2
EC2 can be used for a variety of purposes:

->Hosting Websites and Applications: Run web applications and sites with customizable instances.
->Data Processing and Big Data Applications: EC2 supports large-scale data processing with a range of instance types optimized for memory or storage.
->Machine Learning and AI Workloads: With instances powered by GPUs and specialized hardware, EC2 is suitable for training ML models.
->Gaming Servers: Host scalable, responsive gaming servers.
->Batch Processing Jobs: Execute automated tasks or repetitive processes in batches.
->Backend for Mobile and Web Apps: Ideal for apps with backend processing needs and low latency requirements.

# When to Use EC2
EC2 is most useful when:
->You need scalable, on-demand compute power.
->You want to avoid upfront investment in physical servers.
->Your application has unpredictable traffic or growth patterns.
->You need global deployment with a low-latency architecture.

# 4. Benefits of Using EC2
->Scalability and Flexibility: Easily scale instances up or down based on traffic or processing needs. EC2 allows horizontal and vertical scaling.
->Wide Variety of Instance Types: EC2 offers instances optimized for different use cases, such as general-purpose, compute-optimized, memory-optimized, storage-optimized, and GPU-based instances.
->Global Availability: EC2 instances are available across multiple AWS regions and Availability Zones (AZs), providing high availability and low latency.
->Security and Compliance: Built-in security features and the ability to comply with major industry standards.
->Integration with AWS Ecosystem: EC2 integrates with AWS services like S3, RDS, Lambda, and others, simplifying complex architectures.
->Pay-As-You-Go Pricing: You only pay for what you use, reducing costs for infrequently used or unpredictable workloads.

# 5. EC2 Pricing Models(Purchasing options)
Amazon EC2 provides several pricing models that allow for cost optimization:

->On-Demand Instances: Pay by the second (with a minimum of 60 seconds) for instances you launch. Ideal for short-term, unpredictable workloads.

->Reserved Instances (RI): Commitment to use an instance for a 1- or 3-year term, with up to 75% savings compared to on-demand. Suited for steady-state workloads.

->Spot Instances: Bid on unused EC2 capacity at significantly lower prices, with up to 90% cost savings. Good for flexible, fault-tolerant applications.

->Savings Plans: Flexible pricing option with a commitment to a consistent amount of usage (measured in dollars per hour) for a 1- or 3-year term.

->Dedicated Hosts: Physical servers dedicated to a single customer, useful for meeting strict compliance or regulatory requirements.

->Dedicated Instances: Instances that run on hardware dedicated to a single customer, useful for isolated environments and specialized security requirements.

# 6. Estimating Costs for EC2
EC2 costs are variable and depend on several factors:

->Instance Type: Costs vary based on the type (e.g., t3.medium, m5.large) and purpose (general-purpose, compute-optimized, etc.).
->Instance Region: Costs can differ based on the region due to infrastructure costs and regional demand.
->Usage Time: You are billed by the hour or second, so shorter usage costs less.
->Additional Features: You may incur extra costs for additional storage (e.g., EBS volumes), data transfer, and specialized services (e.g., Elastic Load Balancing).
To estimate costs:

Use the AWS Pricing Calculator to get detailed cost estimates.
Evaluate the cost implications of different pricing models, and leverage Spot or Reserved Instances for long-term cost savings.

# Interview questions for aws ec2
1. What is EC2, and how does it fit within the AWS ecosystem?
Answer: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service provided by AWS that allows users to run virtual servers (instances) in the cloud. EC2 provides resizable compute capacity, allowing users to scale resources up or down as needed. It fits into the AWS ecosystem as the central compute resource, integrating with other services like Amazon S3 for storage, RDS for databases, and IAM for access control, which enables a comprehensive, cloud-based application architecture.

2. Explain the differences between EC2 instance types like On-Demand, Reserved, and Spot instances.
Answer:

On-Demand Instances: Pay-per-use pricing without any commitment, suitable for short-term, unpredictable workloads.
Reserved Instances (RIs): Offer significant savings for workloads that are predictable and long-term, with a commitment of 1 or 3 years.
Spot Instances: Enable up to 90% cost savings by using spare AWS capacity; however, they can be interrupted when AWS needs the resources, making them ideal for flexible, fault-tolerant workloads.

3. How does EC2 Auto Scaling work, and why would you use it?
Answer: EC2 Auto Scaling automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on demand by setting scaling policies based on metrics like CPU usage. This helps maintain application availability, improves fault tolerance, and reduces costs by scaling down during low demand. For example, if CPU usage exceeds 80% consistently, Auto Scaling can add instances, while scaling down when demand is low.

4. How would you secure an EC2 instance?
Answer: Securing an EC2 instance involves several key steps:

Use Security Groups: Control traffic to/from the instance by defining specific IP ranges and protocols.
Disable Root Access and Use IAM Roles: Avoid root SSH access and attach an IAM role with only the necessary permissions.
Implement Firewalls and NACLs: Use Network ACLs for additional network-layer security.
Update the Operating System and Patch Software: Regularly update to avoid vulnerabilities.
Enable VPC Flow Logs: Monitor traffic to detect any unusual activity.

5. Explain how Security Groups and NACLs differ and how they’re used with EC2 instances.
Answer: Security Groups act as a virtual firewall at the instance level, allowing or denying inbound and outbound traffic based on specified rules. NACLs (Network Access Control Lists), on the other hand, operate at the subnet level, applying rules to all instances within that subnet. Security Groups are stateful, meaning return traffic is automatically allowed, while NACLs are stateless and require explicit rules for inbound and outbound traffic.

6. Describe how you’d launch an EC2 instance with a specific AMI and custom configuration using the CLI.

Answer:
aws ec2 run-instances \
    --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 \
    --instance-type t2.micro \
    --key-name my-key-pair \
    --security-group-ids sg-12345678 \
    --subnet-id subnet-12345678 \
    --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=instance,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=MyInstance}]' \
    --user-data file://my-script.sh
This command launches an EC2 instance with a specified AMI, instance type, and security group, while applying tags and running a custom script from my-script.sh.

7. How would you configure an EC2 instance to be highly available?
Answer: To ensure high availability, I’d distribute instances across multiple Availability Zones within a region and use an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to manage incoming traffic. Additionally, I’d set up Auto Scaling to handle failovers and traffic spikes, and Route 53 can manage DNS failover in the event of regional outages.

8. Explain the difference between an Elastic IP and a public IP in the context of EC2.
Answer: An Elastic IP is a static IPv4 address associated with an AWS account, allowing it to be moved between instances or Elastic Network Interfaces. Public IPs are dynamic and assigned automatically to instances when launched; they change if the instance is stopped and started. Elastic IPs are ideal for applications needing a consistent IP address for external access.

9. How does Amazon EBS differ from instance store storage, and when would you use each?
Answer: Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) provides persistent storage that can be attached to instances, retains data even if the instance is stopped, and offers options like snapshots and encryption. Instance Store is ephemeral storage that exists only during the instance's lifetime and is deleted when the instance stops or terminates. EBS is suited for applications requiring durable storage, while instance store is good for temporary data, like caches or buffers.

10. How would you configure EBS snapshots for backup and recovery, and what are their limitations?
Answer: EBS snapshots can be configured manually or scheduled with AWS Backup or Lambda. Snapshots capture incremental data changes and can be used to create new EBS volumes. Limitations include time taken for the initial snapshot and the potential storage costs if not managed. They’re also constrained by the same AWS region.

11. How would you reduce costs for a workload running continuously on EC2 instances?
Answer: I’d evaluate Reserved Instances (RIs) or Savings Plans for long-term cost savings, implement Auto Scaling to reduce resources during off-peak times, use Spot Instances for non-critical workloads, and regularly review instance sizes and utilization to avoid over-provisioning.

12. Explain the role of EC2 Spot Instances. How would you handle workload interruptions?
Answer: Spot Instances are ideal for flexible, fault-tolerant applications since they allow access to unused capacity at a discounted rate. To manage interruptions, I would architect the application to be stateless and use Auto Scaling to automatically replace terminated instances. Additionally, storing critical data outside the instance, like in S3, helps maintain resilience.

13. What is the AWS Pricing Calculator, and how would you use it to estimate the cost of an EC2-based application?
Answer: The AWS Pricing Calculator lets you estimate costs based on factors like instance types, regions, storage, and data transfer. By configuring the expected usage for each component, I can provide a detailed cost estimate, helping to budget effectively and choose the best pricing model (e.g., Spot, Reserved, or On-Demand).

14. Describe the different ways you can monitor the performance of EC2 instances.
Answer: EC2 monitoring is managed through Amazon CloudWatch, which provides metrics like CPU usage, disk I/O, network traffic, and custom metrics. Setting up CloudWatch Alarms can notify on threshold breaches, and EC2 instance metadata provides additional insights into instance status and configuration.

15. An EC2 instance is experiencing slow performance. How would you go about troubleshooting this?
Answer: I’d start by checking CloudWatch metrics for CPU, memory, and disk I/O. Next, I’d inspect network traffic to identify potential bottlenecks, look at the EBS volume’s performance, check instance type suitability, and review software logs. Upgrading to a larger instance type or optimizing the application might also be necessary.

16. How would you provision an EC2 instance using AWS CloudFormation or Terraform?
Answer: In CloudFormation, I’d define a stack with resources including AWS::EC2::Instance. With Terraform, I’d use aws_instance and specify the AMI, instance type, tags, and networking. IaC allows versioned, repeatable deployments, essential for scalable cloud environments.

17. What is the AWS Shared Responsibility Model, and how does it apply to EC2?
Answer: In the AWS Shared Responsibility Model, AWS manages security of the cloud (infrastructure, hardware, and managed services), while customers are responsible for security in the cloud, such as data, configurations, and access controls on EC2 instances. This means securing the OS, applying patches, and managing access.
